# Contributing
This project is more of a solo kind of project for me, so I will do all of the implementing of features.

## Issues I would appreciate
- reporting bugs that are found
- requesting features
- API changes that make the engine easier to use

## Pull Requests I would appreciate
- Fix small bugs
- Add documentation/wording
